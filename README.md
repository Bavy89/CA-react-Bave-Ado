## Features

- **Homepage 🏠**: Displays all available products and includes a predictive search bar for quick filtering.
- **Cart Page 🛒**: Shows all items added to the cart and calculates the total. Hitting the "Checkout" button redirects to the order confirmation page.
- **Product Detail Page 🛍️**: Provides detailed information for each product, such as name, description, and image. It also lists any available customer reviews.
- **Order Success Page 🎉**: Confirms a successful purchase and offers a link to return to the store.
- **Contact Us Page 📞**: Features a contact form with built-in validation.

The app leverages **React Router** for navigation across different pages and uses a `<Layout>` component to include a common header and footer. The header contains a navigation menu and a shopping cart icon that updates with the number of items in the cart.
